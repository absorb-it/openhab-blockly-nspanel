# Helper: get Icon for Name

## Configuration

[<img src="img/blockLibrary_nspanel_helpers_getIconForName.png" align="right" width="300">](img/blockLibrary_nspanel_helpers_getIconForName.png)

Just supply a string from the [Material Design Icons](https://docs.nspanel.pky.eu/icon-cheatsheet.html) page - and you will get the Icon for it. This function is really heavy and maybe not required at all. If you have to lookup the Icon table anyway to find the right nam, you can also just copy the Icon itself.<br clear="right"/>

## Important Note

The array, which is needed to hold all these icons and search for the one you like is really big. Therefore it might take a good while till some code preview is rendered in openHAB. During development, I suggest to ignore this function - just add your fancy icons as the last act before 'release'.
