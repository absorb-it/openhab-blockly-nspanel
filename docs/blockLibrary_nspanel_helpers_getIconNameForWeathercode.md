Using the [FMI Weather Binding](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/fmiweather/) you can get the weather forecast from the [Finnish Metereological Institute](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/).

Beside some other weather information you will get some weather code indicating the weather conditions. With this helper you can convert this number to some suitable icon name, which can be converted into the real icon with the [Name to Icon converter](blockLibrary_nspanel_helpers_getIconForName.md). The conversion is based on the information found at [github](https://github.com/sevesalm/eInk-weather-display/blob/master/weather_icon_codes.md).<br clear="right"/>
