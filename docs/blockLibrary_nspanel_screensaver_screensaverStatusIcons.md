# Screensaver Status Icons

On the screensaver, two status Icons can be displayed on the top ([standard screensaver](https://docs.nspanel.pky.eu/img/screensaver.png)) or on the bottom ([complex screensaver](https://docs.nspanel.pky.eu/img/screensaver2.png)) of the display.

**Important:** This module will do nothing if called directly without any context. At least it requires some information about the *NSPanel Item* to work with, which is usually supplied from the *CallBack* calling the script with this module. To [enable direct testing in your Blockly editor](blockLibrary_nspanel_helpers_setNSPanelIfNotContext.md) or to [force the *NSPanel Item*](blockLibrary_nspanel_helpers_startScriptWithContext.md) you can use the related helpers. To get to know [which *NSPanel Item* you are working on](blockLibrary_nspanel_helpers_getContextItem.md), use some helper as well.
