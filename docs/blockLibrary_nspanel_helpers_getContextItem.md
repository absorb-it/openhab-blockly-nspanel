The *Cards* you are going to create, the Pages you are going to display on the panel are configured in scripts without any information about the *NSPanel Items* they should run on. This information is provided by the calling *CallBack* rule, which is triggered by the panel you are working with. This way you can re-use the same *Card* for different Panels in your automation.

To get the information about this *Context Target* you can use this statement. Now you are able to build for instance links to other pages on your own by sending the [loadPage](blockLibrary_nspanel_callback_callback.md#loadpage)-request to the context NSPanel Item.<br clear="right"/>
